    <h2>Rodrigo Avalos</h2>
    <p>Hello. My name is Rodrigo. I am from Mexico, City but I live in Puerto Pe√±asco, Sonora, Mexico. 
        I lived six years in the USA and four years in Australia. 
        I love Mexican food. I like to go to the gym and spend time with my family. 
        If I am not studying, I am working. Something unique about me is that I look younger than my real age.</p>
    <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Hospitality and Tourism Management. Also, I have a Master's degree 
        in International Hotel Management.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints my entire life. I served a mission in
        Chihuahua, Mexico</p>
